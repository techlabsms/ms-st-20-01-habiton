                            	Outcome are the things you get or the goals you set. For example you have the goal to loose weight or get a degree. You can accomplish these goals or tell people: "Oh, I am trying to quit smoking." But telling people doesn´t make you a non smoking person. Action does. To change your habits you have to go a bit deeper for a lasting change. Just like in "Ineception". </div>

                            <div class="card-body">The processes are the things and actions you take to accomplish the goals you´ve set for yourself. For example tell people or yourself that you study a lot and therefore think you will get good grades. Most of the time that is only half the magic. So changing our actions takes us closer to making lasting changes, but is not enough.</div>

The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.” What kind of person to you wish to become?</div>

                    <p>Understanding the logic behind doing something - a habit</p>
                    <p> Que – Craving – Response – Reward. That is the cicle of doing something. First it the que: a signal triggers the craving. We are bombared with many signal all day long, they are meaningless until we give the meaning. To start a habit, you need to make the signal that triggers your habit obvious. That can come in different size and shapes, in a reminder on your phone, a post-it or anything that is obvious to you. 
                    </p><p>
                    The signal triggers the craving, the desire to change your internal state. You want to change how you feel and therefor eat snacks or lay on your coach, but also go for a run or start working. Importantent is that you make your habit attractive. Either think about the shower after the run, do it with friend, listen to music. What ever works best for you. 
                    </p><p>
                    The craving follows your response, an action or thought. Humans tend to take the “Law of Least Effort” and rather want to choose the option with the least amout of action. Building habits is not a sprint, but a marathon. You need to get your reps in. So start small, as small as you need to actually do the habit. It doesn´t have to be perfect and it doesn´t have to be very long. There the "Two-Minute Rule" helps, you start with 2 minutes of the habit you want to build. For example: read one page, write a sentence a day.
                    </p><p>
                    For your response there is an immediate reward and a long term consquence (positive or negative). The human brain will want the immediate reward over the delayed reward. This reward will determine if the behaviour is repeated or not. Find a way to give the wanted behaviour an immediate reward. That can be ticking it out a list or the hot shower after the run. Make it satisfy and rewarding to reapeat the behaviour.</p>
